                <p>After the announcement of the start of construction of the Tashkent City MDC project, the developer of Lot No. 4 "Murad Buildings" held negotiations with companies from Japan, Singapore, America and other countries for two years. The choice was made for the company "Özgüven Mimarlık", which had previously implemented projects in Turkey and in other countries of the world. More than 500 specialists worked on the development of the building project. The design of the skyscraper was developed by the Japanese design organization Nihon Sekken.

                    The study of the soil composition was undertaken by the company Zetas Zemin Teknolojisi A.S. (Turkey), specializing in the study of the soil under the foundation of high-rise structures.
                    
                    The management of the construction process, costs and deadlines, quality control, ecology, safety and labor protection was entrusted to the French company Bureau Veritas.</p>
